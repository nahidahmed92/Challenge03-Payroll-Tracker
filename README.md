# Challenge 03

## Employee Payroll Tracker

In this challenge I have added functions and while loops using alerts and prompt to enter employee data to a table. Then used a for loop to get the average of all employees salary. Last, I used Math.Floor and Math.Random getting a random number that will choose a random employee.
